Steps for Implementation:
Define Input Structure:

The system should prompt users to enter details like:
Date of the expense.
Amount spent.
Category (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
Description or notes (optional).
Input Validation:

Ensure that the input is in the correct format:
Date in a specific format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Amount should be a positive number.
Categories should be predefined or user-defined with a valid name.
Implement checks to handle incorrect inputs, such as invalid dates or non-numeric values for amounts.
Data Management:

Store the user input in a structured way, possibly using:
A list of dictionaries (each dictionary represents a single expense).
A database or file (JSON, CSV) for persistence if required.


Data Storage: Implement a Mechanism to Store and Manage Expense Data
You need a way to store the expenses entered by users. This can be done in two ways:

In-Memory (Temporary storage): Store data in variables like lists or dictionaries during the runtime of the program.
Persistent Storage: Store data in files like JSON, CSV, or databases so that it remains accessible even after the program is closed.
Expense Categories: Categorize Expenses for Better Organization
Organizing expenses into categories helps users analyze their spending better. You can create a predefined list of categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment), and also allow users to add custom categories.
Data Analysis: Provide Monthly Summaries and Category-Wise Expenditure
Data analysis will give insights like:

Total expenses per month.
Category-wise expenses for each month.
You can analyze the stored data using Pythonâ€™s datetime module and functions like sum()
 User-Friendly Interface: Create a Seamless User Experience
A command-line interface (CLI) is easy to implement initially. Later, you can upgrade it to a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like tkinter if needed.

 Error Handling: Gracefully Manage Unexpected Inputs

  Documentation: Ensure Code Clarity and Understanding
Document your code using comments and docstrings so that others can understand it easi
Error handling is important to prevent the application from crashing due to bad input.
Suggested Timeline:
Day 1-2: Focus on User Input and Data Management.
Day 3: Implement Data Storage (JSON or CSV) and Expense Categories.
Day 4-5: Work on Data Analysis and User Interface.
Day 6: Add Error Handling.
Day 7: Finalize the project with Documentation and testing.
