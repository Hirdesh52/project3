Steps for Implementation:
Define Input Structure:

The system should prompt users to enter details like:
Date of the expense.
Amount spent.
Category (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
Description or notes (optional).
Input Validation:

Ensure that the input is in the correct format:
Date in a specific format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Amount should be a positive number.
Categories should be predefined or user-defined with a valid name.
Implement checks to handle incorrect inputs, such as invalid dates or non-numeric values for amounts.
Data Management:

Store the user input in a structured way, possibly using:
A list of dictionaries (each dictionary represents a single expense).
A database or file (JSON, CSV) for persistence if required.
